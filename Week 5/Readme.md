# Mini Project Week 5  : Analysis of Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) Dataset

## Introduction
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing the **Road Traffic Accidents (RTA)** dataset to uncover patterns, causes, and trends related to road safety. By understanding accident conditions and casualty details, this project aims to improve road safety through data-driven insights.

## Dataset Overview
The **RTA Dataset** provides a detailed snapshot of road traffic accidents, capturing information such as:
- **Accident conditions** (e.g., weather, road surface).
- **Casualty details** (e.g., age, severity, type).
  
This dataset is essential for analyzing accident patterns and contributing to road safety improvements.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to:
1. Explore and visualize traffic accident patterns.
2. Identify significant contributing factors to accidents.
3. Provide recommendations for improving road safety.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We conducted an analysis on the provided dataset and generated several key visualizations, including traffic patterns and comparisons of different cities based on traffic data.
